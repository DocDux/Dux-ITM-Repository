def bin_to_dec(binary_string):
    '''
    Convert a binary string to its base-10 integer representation.
    
    Example:
    bin_to_dec("101") -> 5
    bin_to_dec("1010") -> 10
    bin_to_dec("11111111") -> 255
    bin_to_dec("0") -> 0
    bin_to_dec("1") -> 1
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    binary_str: str
        The binary string to be converted to a base-10 integer.
        The string should contain only the characters '0' and '1'.
    
    Returns
    -------
    int
        The base-10 integer representation of the input binary string.
    
    Notes
    -----
    Binary is a base-2 number system that uses only two digits: 0 and 1. 
    Each digit in a binary number is called a "bit". The position of each bit 
    represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost bit (2^0), the next bit 
    to the left (2^1), and so on. To understand a binary number, convert it to 
    decimal by summing the products of each bit and its corresponding power of 2.
    
    For example, the binary string "1011" is calculated as:
    (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)
    = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11

def dec_to_bin(number):
    '''
    Convert a base-10 number to its binary string representation.
    
    Example:
    dec_to_bin(5) -> "101"
    dec_to_bin(10) -> "1010"
    dec_to_bin(255) -> "11111111"

    Parameters
    ----------

   # how to perform the conversion from decimal to binary (mathematically)
# 1. Divide the number by 2
# 2. Get the integer quotient (which we will divide again by 2)
# 3. Get the remainder (this will be our binary digit)
# 4. Repeat the steps above until the quotient is equal to 0
# 5. Our final binary string will be the "list" of remainders in #3 joined together (IN REVERSE ORDER)

def telephone_cipher(message):
    '''
    Before, when phones did not have touchscreen keypads, 
    the way to input letters was to click the physical keypads 
    repeatedly.
    
    For example:
    Clicking "222" will result in the letter C. 
    Clicking "7777" will result in the letter S. 
    and so on

    Telephone Keypad: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keypad
    
    Using the `encoder_dict` in "set_4_given.py",
    your task is to convert a letter string into its equivalent
    numerical string as typed in a Telephone Keypad.
    
    Note: In the case of text inputs like "ABC", to demarcate the
    same letters, an underscore "_" is placed in between.
    
    Examples:
    telephone_cipher("ABC") -> "2_22_222"
    telephone_cipher("HELLO WORLD") -> "4433555_555666096667775553"
    telephone_cipher("TEST") -> "83377778"
    telephone_cipher("HOW DO YOU DO") -> "4466690366609996668803666"
    telephone_cipher("ABRACADABRA") -> "2_227772_222_232_227772"

    ----------
